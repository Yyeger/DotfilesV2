Sway / Arch / Nord-Theme

random stuff i use / like / need to remember:

spotify with spicetify ( runs on xwayland FIXED WITH FLAG ozone ) \
firefox with cascade and some extensions like dark-reader and ublock-origin, i should add arkennfox user.js \
alacritty with fish \
sway (i try to run everything natively on wayland), no problem with screensharing after setting up xdg portals (xfce4 as a backup) \
micro editor or codium/intellij-community \
tlp and tlp-rdw has been great for battery life \
standard linux kernel (didn't like the zen) \
zathura \
pipewire \
btrfs with swapfile that let's me hibernite (no zswap) \
no dual-boot (if wine/proton/a vm with windows can't run it i'll not use it) \
grub \
i'd like to move away from systemd in the future \
sometimes had problems with cursor size / font / theme inconsistency, fixed with random env variables and configs
